# File Indexing & Metadata Store Project Ideas

This project is gonig to be about creating:

* A file indexer that can run periodically in the background either
in a daemon or container
* A sqlite standard of database to hold file metadata
* A bitrot detector using checksums of files indexed
* A file manager that can be used as an app or web interface
* A scriptable file manager
* A quick file deduplicator

## Example Projects to Follow

[Indexxo][indexxo-gh] is an interesting take on the project with many similar ideas.
It might actually be a good idea to team up with them.
