# Message Queue Pattern

## Introduction

>In computer science, **message queues** and
>mailboxes are software-engineering components typically used for
>inter-process communication (IPC),
>or for inter-thread communication within the same process.
>They use a queue for messaging â€“ the passing of control or of content.
>Group communication systems provide similar kinds of functionality.
>
>The message queue paradigm is a sibling of
>the [publisher/subscriber pattern][-pub-sub],
>and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system.
>Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and
>message queue models in their API
>
