# Javascript

Javascript is the only first class citizen [programming language][-lang]
of the browser.
It has also in recent years become a prime player in backend servers,
thanks to [NodeJS][js-node-zk].

## NodeJS

NodeJS is the most common server runtime for javascript to
run javascript outside the browser.
This has made Javascript into a powerful community in the realm of
backend server programming for the web since now
programming web app frontends & backends can be done in the same language.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript][-ts] is a superscript of that adds type annotations.

## Jest

Jest is perhaps the most common testing library for the
Javascript & Typescript ecosystems.
*More detailed information can be found in the [jest page][jest-zk].*
