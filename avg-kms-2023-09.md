# Applied Value Group: Knowledge Management System September 2023

This is my monthly dev-log on the Applied Value Kknowledge Management System.

## Meeting 2023-09-12

* Sassja
    * Need a discovery phase
    * Good for orgs to discover how to work with AI
    * Whois?
* Matti
    * Need to setup admin priveleges
* Bruce
    * Quality control
      * Tags for quality control
    * Adding more template tags like these
* Carl
    * Don't reinvent the wheel
    * We need to be careful about not creating too many maintenance dependencies
        * I mostly agree - but we need some level of data pipeline nonetheless

## Authorization

Authentication has been a sticking point earlier this month.
Box makes it exceptionally difficult to set authorization settings.
What I've learned so far...

* The authentication to authorization flow goes something like this right (JWT)
    * The app token is created by craeting a custom app on the Box Dev Console
    * The box token was created with Custom App mode and Enterprise access
        * The real question is if this is even necessary,
            this will need to be tested in the future because
            it may not be wise to have this permissive a token.
    * The latest `avg-kms` app token does work however and
        crucially it works when performing API operations using
        user grants of any user.

### Authenticating the BoxSDK Client (Python)

```python
from boxsdk import Client, JWTAuth

auth = JWTAuth.from_settings_file(JWT_JSON_TOKEN_FROM_DEV_CONSOLE.json)
auth.authenticate_instance()
client = Client(auth)

client = self.get_client()
try:
    # user = client.user(user_id=user_id).get()
    user = client.user(user_id=user_id)
    client = client.as_user(user)
    username = client.user().get().name
    print(f"Debug: Client should now act as user {username}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to authenticate as user {user_id}: {e}")

folder = self.client.folder(folder_id=dir_id)
items = [item for item in folder.get_items()]
print(items)
```

This code snippet above creates an `auth` object from `JWTAuth` from `boxsdk`.
This will craete an auth object that has all of the authorization configurations of
the JWT token created from the *Box Dev Console*.
This can be used to create a `Client` object or `client` that
can be used to perform Box SDK operations, like viewing the contents of a folder.

First to be able to perform these operations as a different user,
you need to use the client authenticated with the `JWTAuth`,
to then use the `client.as_user(client.user(user_id=SOME_USER_ID))`,
which finally gets you an updated `Client` object that
now performs SDK operations as that user with user ID `SOME_USER_ID`.
