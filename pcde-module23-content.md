# PCDE Course Module 23 Content

## Introduction

In this module,
you will be working on another project that you can add to your portfolio.
In the first section, you will be introduced to Project 23.1,
in which you will create a sense-making data pipeline.
In the next section, you will learn about visualization, unstructured data,
and JavaScript.
First, you will learn how unstructured data differs from structured data.
Next, you will learn how JavaScript can be used for web development and
will research specific use cases for JavaScript.
You will also learn how the document object model (DOM) and
HTML tags can be used to enhance web pages.
Finally,
you will practice visualization using the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library to
visualize word frequency data.
In Project 23.1,
you will perform data analysis on unstructured MIT course catalog data and
use the D3 library to create a visualization of word frequency data.

Note: Make sure you have installed the tools you will need for Modules 23-24 in
the Course Tools Module before beginning this module.
