# Cassandra

**Cassandra** is another NoSQL [database][db-types-zk] that
was developed initially by Facebook.
**Cassandra** is a [distributed scalable database][dist-db-zk].
These are the features of **Cassandra**:

* *Highly scalable*: It can be easily expanded or upgraded on demand.
* *Fault-tolerant*: **Cassandra** was designed to
continue operating uninterrupted despite the failure of a component.
The same copy of data is stored in multiple locations as a *cluster*.
Data is *available* on multiple computers at once.
* *High availability (HA)*: HA refers to the continuous availability of
applications and data to authorized users and
includes all aspects of a hardware and software environment that could fail,
such as disk, CPU, mainframe, physical site, or regional outage.
* *Decentralized*: **Cassandra** can be spread out across many servers while
providing highly available service with no single point of failure.
* *Nodes* are set up in the form of *clusters*:
A *node* in Cassandra contains the actual data.
A *cluster* is a collection of *nodes* that represent a single system.
Every *node* is independent.

In Cassandra, a database or data container is called a *keyspace*.
Each keyspace is a separate entity created for each application within a *cluster*.

>"In a Cassandra *cluster*, a keyspace is an outermost object that
>determines how data replicates on *nodes*.
>Keyspaces consist of core objects called column families
>(which are like tables in RDBMS), rows indexed by keys, datatypes,
>data center awareness, replication factor, and keyspace strategy" (PhoenixNAP 2020).

## Running Cassandra in a Docker Container

First, you need to run a **Cassandra** container in Docker to
practice interfacing with the database.
To download a **Cassandra** Docker image and run it,
execute the following command from a Windows PowerShell or
from a Terminal window on a Mac:

```sh
docker run -p 9042:9042 --name some-cassandra -d cassandra
```

Open Docker desktop and verify that the **Cassandra** image is up and running:

**Cassandra** image in Docker.

## Python Driver Cassandra

You can use Python code to access the **Cassandra** database.
To do so, you will need to install Python libraries for **Cassandra**:

```sh
pip3 install cassandra-driver
```

The sample code below will create a keyspace, also known as a database,
in **Cassandra** called employees.
It will then create a table called employee and
insert three employees into the table.

```py
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
keyspace = None
cluster = Cluster(['localhost'], port=9042)
session = cluster.connect(keyspace)

session.execute("""
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS employees
    WITH REPLICATION = {'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor' :1};
    """)

session.set_keyspace('employees')

session.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (
        EMPLOYEE_ID int PRIMARY KEY,
        FIRST_NAME text,
        LAST_NAME text,
        AGE int
    );
""")

session.execute("""
    INSERT INTO employee (EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE)
    VALUES (123450, 'John', 'Doe', 33);
""")

session.execute("""
    INSERT INTO employee (EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE)
    VALUES (123678, 'Mary', 'Jane', 21);
""")

session.execute("""
    INSERT INTO employee (EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE)
    VALUES (678123, 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 65);
""")

The sample code below reads the data from the employees keyspace:

from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

cluster = Cluster(['localhost'], port=9042)
session = cluster.connect('employees', wait_for_all_pools=True)
session.execute('USE employees')
rows = session.execute('SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE')
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

## Interfacing with Cassandra in the Terminal

You have now interfaced with **Cassandra** using a Python client.
Another method to do this is to use the `cqlsh` Terminal command line.
To launch `cqlsh`, open the Docker desktop and select the "CLI" option for
the **Cassandra** container.
CLI is a command line tool that allows you to communicate with the Docker server:

Enter the `cqlsh` command and hit enter:

```sh
cqlsh
cqlsh> use employees;
cqlsh:employees>
```

You are now connected directly to the **Cassandra** database.
There is no need to write Python code to select or insert rows.

Enter use employees;. Donâ€™t forget the "`;`" at
the end of the command to tell `cqlsh` that you finished the command,
and select the "`Enter`" key:

Now enter `select * from employee`; to get employees:

```sh
cqlsh> use employees;
cqlsh:employees> select * from employee;
 employee_id | age | first_name | last_name
 ------------+-----+------------+----------
      123678 |  21 |       Mary |      Jane
      678123 |  65 |      Peter |   Gabriel
      123450 |  33 |       John |       Doe
(r rows)
```
