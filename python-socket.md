# Socket (Python Std.Lib.)

## Introduction

>The [Python][-py] interface is a straightforward transliteration of
>the [Unix][-unix] system call and library interface for sockets to
>Pythonâ€™s object-oriented style:
>the `socket()` function returns a socket object whose
>methods implement the various socket system calls.
>Parameter types are somewhat higher-level than in the C interface:
>as with `read()` and `write()` operations on Python files,
>buffer allocation on receive operations is automatic,
>and buffer length is implicit on send operations.
