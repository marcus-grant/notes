# Algorithm

## Introduction

>In [mathematics][-math] and [computer science][-cs],
>an **algorithm** is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions,
>typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.
>Algorithms are used as specifications for
>performing calculations and data processing.

## Machine Learning

[Machine Learning][-ml] algorithms are used to train models from
training data to make predictions on new data and
iterating the algorithm based on an objective function.
