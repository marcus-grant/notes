# Data Warehouse

## Introduction

>"In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH),
>also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW),
>is a system used for reporting and data analysis and
>is considered a core component of business intelligence.[^1]
>DWs are central repositories of integrated data from
>one or more disparate sources.
>They store current and historical data in one single place[^2]
>that are used for creating analytical reports for
>workers throughout the enterprise.[3]
>This is beneficial for companies as it enables them to interrogate and
>draw insights from their data and make decisions."[4]
