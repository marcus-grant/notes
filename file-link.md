# File Link (File System)

## Introduction

>In computing, a **symbolic link** (also **symlink** or **soft link**)
>is a file whose purpose is to point to a file or directory
>(called the "target") by specifying a path thereto.
>
>Symbolic links are supported by POSIX and
>most [UNIX-like][-linux] [operating systems][-os],
>and in [Windows-based][-windows] operating systems via **shortcut files**
>[(Wikipedia 2023)][wiki23]

## What Are Symbolic Links

>Symbolic links are basically advanced shortcuts.
>Create a symbolic link to an individual file or folder,
>and that link will appear to be the same as the file or folder to Windows -
>even though itâ€™s just a link pointing at the file or folder.
>[(Hoffman 2022)][howtogeek22]
