# Command Line Interfaces (CLI) Overview

A **command-line interpreter** or
**command-line processor** uses a
**command-line interface** to
receive commands from a user in the form of lines of text.
This allows for a very basic user interface to
set configurations, invoke executables and providing information to them as
to what actions they are to perform on an [operating system][os-wiki].
For brevity, **command-line interfaces** are abbreviated here as **CLI**.
Usually command-line interfaces are
a textual component to an OS's [shell](os-shell.md).

Terminals are a common way to refer to CLIs and were once
the preferred way of interacting with a computer.
Today the word, terminal, often gets used when referring to a terminal emulator.
Terminal emulators, are actually a software program that
emulates hardware terminals of old.
Now terminals are normally just applications that give
a *CLI* to an operating system's [shell][shell-wiki].
