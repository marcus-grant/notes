# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

>**Internet Relay Chat** (**IRC**) is a text-based chat system for
>instant messaging.
>IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels,
>but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as
>chat and data transfer, including file sharing.
>
>Internet Relay Chat is implemented as an [application layer protocol][-tcp-ip] to
>facilitate communication in the form of text.
>The chat process works on a [client–server networking model][-cl-srv].
>Users connect, using a client—which may be a web app,
>a standalone desktop program,
>or embedded into part of a larger program—to an IRC server,
>which may be part of a larger IRC network.
>Examples of programs used to connect include Mibbit, IRCCloud, KiwiIRC, and mIRC.
