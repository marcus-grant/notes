# Airflow (Apache Python Platform for Automation Workflows)

>**Apache Airflow** is an open-source workflow management platform for
>data engineering pipelines.
>It started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to
>manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.
>Creating Airflow allowed Airbnb to programmatically author and
>schedule their workflows and monitor them via
>the built-in Airflow [user interface][-gui].
>From the beginning, the project was made open source,
>becoming an Apache Incubator project in March 2016 and
>a top-level Apache Software Foundation project in January 2019.
>Airflow is written in [Python][-py], and workflows are created via Python scripts.
>Airflow is designed under the principle of *"configuration as code"*.
>While other *"configuration as code"* workflow platforms exist using
>markup languages like [XML][-xml],
>using Python allows developers to import libraries and
>classes to help them create their workflows.

***TODO:*** Include the module notes in module 22.

>***TODO***: There should be a data engineering topics index.
>The PCDE course outline is a good place to pull from.
>Create one with some conceptual outlines and
>new documents with core concepts and
>include a lot of the links relevant from the PCDE outline therein.
>Note that this document mentions it and should be linked as such.
