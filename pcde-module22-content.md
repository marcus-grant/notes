# PCDE Course Module 22 Content

## Introduction

In this module,
you will learn about processing and
streaming big data using the pandas library, the Apache Parquet format,
and the Apache Feather format.
You will begin by comparing the functionality and speed of the Parquet and
Feather formats when processing large datasets.
Next, you will explore the advantages of
parallel computing and learn the basics of DASK,
a parallel computing Python library.
You will practice using the DASK library to create, read, write,
and analyze multiple files in parallel and
simulate parallel processing across distributed machines.
In the next section,
you will learn how web sockets are used as a communication protocol and
how to stream data through web sockets.
The final assignment for this module consists of two parts.
In the first part of the final assignment,
you will compare the performances of parallel computing with
the pandas, NumPy, and DASK libraries.
In the second part of the final assignment,
you will practice streaming data using web sockets.
