# PCDE Course: Module 20 Content

## Introduction

In this module, you will explore some concepts of
**machine learning** (**ML**) and advanced probability.
First, you will learn about key mathematical concepts that
are at the foundation of some ML algorithms.
Then, you will be introduced to the algorithm of gradient descent,
which is used to minimize the errors in some ML models.
Next, you will learn about advanced probabilliity concepts.
You will delve into Bayes theorem,
Naive Bayes theorem and Gaussian Naive Bayes theorem and
consider real-world applications of each of these algorithms to make predictions.
Finally, you will learn how to implement ML algorithms using Scikit-learn.
In the final assignment,
you will implement Naive Bayes and
Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers using the Python Scikit-learn library.
