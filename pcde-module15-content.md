# PCDE Module 15 Course Content

## Introduction

In this module,
you will be working on two new projects that
you will be able to add to your portfolio.
The projects are divided into three components.
Project 15.1 will use JSON web *server* authentication and authorization that
allows you to control who can use the application and what they are allowed to
do once inside the application.
Project 2 is divided into two parts:
in Project 2 Part 1, you will work with a database using *lists*, *functions*,
and *dictionaries* to compute student grades.
Essentially employing [Python Collections][-py-collections] when
dealing with [relational databases][-db-relational].
In Project 2 Part 2,
you will compute student grades using *redundant dictionaries* and
improve the *functions* in your database.

This module includes two main projects,
divided into three different project submissions:

The first project is Project 15.1: Project 1: Creating a Books Web Application.

In Project 15.1,
you will expand on the concepts you learned in Module 11 to
create a website that shows a *collection* of books.
First, you will learn how to add images to your website.
Next,
you will practice adding more users along with
their respective usernames and passwords.
You will also learn how to allow users with different roles,
such as `admin` or `reader`,
to perform different actions on the website.

The anticipated time to complete this project is
approximately **4 hours and 30 minutes**.

The second project is divided into two submissions:

The first submission for the second project is Project 15.2:
Project 2 Part 1: Creating a Student Grades Database.

In Project 15.2,
you will work in Codio to practice using [Python][-py] *lists*, *functions*,
and *dictionaries* to create a database that contains student names,
information about problem sets that were given to them,
and their grades for each problem.
First, you will work with a simplified version of
the database that is constructed using *lists*.
Next, you will create a more advanced, faster,
and more efficient version of the database that
uses *dictionaries* to store its entries.
Finally,
you will be asked to define some advanced Python *functions* that
compute the weighted average for each student in the database.

The anticipated time to complete this project is approximately four hours.

The second submission for
the second project is Project 15.3:
Project 2 Part 2: Redundant *Dictionaries* in Python.

In Project 15.3,
you will work in Codio to build on your Project 15.2 submission using Python *lists*,
*functions*, and redundant *dictionaries* to enhance your student grades database.
The goal of this project is for you to improve the *functions* to
create the database by using redundant *dictionaries* to define a database that
contains the weighted average for each student in the database.

The anticipated time to complete this project is approximately **2 hours**.

Although the time to complete each project component may vary,
be sure to set aside enough time to
complete each portion of the project for submission.

To review the project details,
please see the full descriptions of each project at the links below:

## Learning Outcomes

1. Define a web *token* architecture.
2. Create an application using web *tokens*.
3. Describe applications of authorization *servers*.
4. Identify key components of relations databases in Python.
5. Create a relational database using Python.
6. Identify key components of relational databases in Python.
7. Implement redundant *dictionaries* in Python.
