# PCDE Course Overview

This is a course where [MIT's xPro program][mit-xpro] will prepare you for a
certification in the professional skills required in Data Engineering.
The course will go through topics in [Python programming](python.md),
the basics of [database design](databases.md).

## First Some Lessons About Good Note Taking

### Interacting with Lectures

It is important to take notes on the content released each week.
Good note taking can even save time on doing activities and assignments,
as the information needed for some of them will often be within good notes taken.

Effective learning includes what goes on before lectures, during and after.
The University of British Columbia
have put together some [recommendations][howto-notetaking] on those three phases.
Also there's another [note](notetaking.md) on notetaking effectively,
including the information presented in University of B.C.'s article.

### Chat with your Learning Facilitators

Regardless of best efforts,
there's often times when we are just stumped.
That's where you should connect with our Learning Facilitators,
**and early**.
Attend office hours frequently,
when possible,
both for information reinforcement and to ask your questions.
Submit support tickets to ask those questions and get additional guidance.
You'll find instructions on how to submit support tickets in your
[Orientation Week Module](pcde-orientation.md).
