# Reinforcement Learning (Machine Learning)

## Introduction

**Reinforcement Learning** is a type of
*unsupervised learning* [algorithm][-algo] that focuses on optimizing the path to
a desired outcome by maximizing the reward and minimizing the penalty.
Or according to [Wikipedia][wiki-rl]:

>**Reinforcement learning** (**RL**) is an area of
>[machine learning][-ml] concerned with how intelligent agents ought to
>take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

## What Defines Reinforcement Learning?

There are a number of factors that define a reinforcement learning model:

* The input is the initial state of the model.
* The output has a vast number of possibilities.
* The model is trained by making a decision and
  is then rewarded or penalized until a prescribed outcome is reached.
* The optimal outcome is derived from the outcome with the highest reward.
* The model can continue to learn.
* Decisions are dependent, so sequences of dependent decisions are labeled.

There are also a number of practical, real-world applications of
reinforcement learning that are worth noting:

* Autonomous Machines and robotics
* Machine Learning and Data Processing
* Generating Custom Instructions
* Any environment in which information is collected by making interactions
