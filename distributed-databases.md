# Distributed Databases

According to [Wikipedia][distributed-db-zk]:

>A **distributed database** is a [database][db-types-zk] in which
>data is stored across different physical locations.[^1]
>It may be stored in multiple computers located in
>the same physical location (e.g. a data centre);
>or maybe dispersed over a network of interconnected computers.

## Cassandra

**Cassandra** is a distributed database that
is designed to handle large amounts of data across many servers.
It is preferred for its scalability and availability.
There's a lot more information on it in the [Cassandra][cassandra-zk] document.
