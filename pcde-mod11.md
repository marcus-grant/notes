# Proffesional Certification Data Engineering - Module 11: Client Server Architecture

## Overview

In this module these topics will be covered:

* Cookies & session cookies
* How session cookies protect API (application programming interface) routes
* How swagger can be used to detail an API
* Developing a Swagger interface
* Writing a [flask](./flask.md) Server
* Handling security tokens
  * Kerberos to understand the need of security tokens
* PKI (public key infrastructure)
  * Signing documents using private keys
  * Passing public key into Github

The most difficult part of this section is
correctly generating secure tokens for authentication,
getting it wrong can mean loss of access to data or
worse leaking data by an attacker.
