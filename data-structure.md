# Data Structure

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in
a computer so that it can be used effectively.
[Wikipedia states it as][data-struct-wiki]:

>In [computer science][-cs], a data structure is a data organization,
>management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. 
>More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values,
>the relationships among them,
>and the functions or operations that can be applied to the [data][-data].

## Data Frames

A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure,
i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
A data frame is a special case of a two-dimensional array,
where the rows and columns are identified with labels rather than simple integer indices.
This makes it easier to manipulate and analyze the data from a human perspective.

### Different Implementations

* [Pandas][pandas-zk]
  * A Python library for data analysis,
implementing a data frame as its primary structure.
