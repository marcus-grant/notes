# Programming Language

## Introduction

**Programming Languages** are the structured languages used to
communicate with computers.
They are used to create programs that instruct the computer to perform specific tasks.
There is even [computer science][-cs] theory that
deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of
programming languages and their individual features. ([Wikipedia 2023][wiki-plt])

## List and Classification of Programming Languages

Programming languages can be classified in many ways.
This is my filtered list of programming languages that
correspond roughlty to
[Wikipedia's classified list of programming languages][wiki-lang-by-type].

### Assembly Languages

**Assembly languages** directly correspond to a machine instruction set.
So machine code instructions appear in a form of human understandable text.
Assembly languages use an *assembler* to convert instructions,
relocatable memory addresses and operands into machine code.

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Languages

[Command-line interface][-cli] (**CLI**) languages *a.k.a. batch languages* are
languages that are designed to be used in a command-line interface or
to script an [operating system][-os] [shell][-shell].

* [Bash][-bash]

### Compiled Languages

**Compiled languages** are languages that are compiled into
machine code directly by a compiler.

* [Java][-java]
* [Rust][-rust]

### Interpreted Languages

**Interpreted languages** are languages that are interpreted by an interpreter
at runtime.

* [JavaScript][-js]
* [TypeScript][-ts]
* [Python][-py]

### Domain Specific Languages (DSL)

Domain specific languages are languages that are designed for a specific domain.

* [SQL][-sql]
* [CSS][-css]
* [HTML][-html]

### Markup Languages

**Markup languages** are languages that are used to annotate text and
data with metadata.

* [Markdown][-md]
* [YAML][-yaml]
* [JSON][-json]
