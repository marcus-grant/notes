# PCDE Course Module 21 Content

## Introduction

In this module,
you will learn about reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.
You will begin with an introduction to machine learning algorithms,
supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.
Next, you will learn about the k-means algorithm,
which is used to cluster points and create clustering pipelines in Python.
Then, you will delve into the confusion matrix in greater detail and
learn about the accuracy score.
In the next section,
you will gain an understanding of reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.
You will explore how a reward matrix is used to demonstrate states, actions,
and rewards in reinforcement learning.
Next, you will learn how the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) and
Bellman equation are used to solve reinforcement learning problems in Python.
Then, you will practice applying these concepts in various activities to
see reinforcement learning from a hands-on perspective.
Finally,
you will learn about deep neural networks exemplified by the Deep Dream exercise.
In the final assignment for this module,
you will practice coding a reinforcement learning algorithm.
