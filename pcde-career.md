# PCDE Career Guidance

## Career Guidance

### Preparing a Data Engineering Portfolio

In this section, you will learn how to create a professional portfolio for
the data engineering industry.
This week, your learning facilitator will host the second in
a series of mentorship workshops, designed to introduce you to
the broader field of data engineering.
The Industry Guidance mentorship workshop will discuss the following topics:

* Developing an industry portfolio and share examples of successful portfolios
* Incorporating your work from this program into your GitHub portfolio to share with prospective employers
* How to approach industry-specific case interviews or technical evaluations

Here are some additional resources to supplement this module’s workshop focus:

* [Facebook, Inc. “Build optimized websites quickly, focus on your content.” Docusaurus. 2022. https://docusaurus.io/.][fb-build-optimal-sites-quick]
* [GitHub. “Data-engineering-pipeline.” GitHub. https://github.com/topics/data-engineering-pipeline.][github-data-engineering-pipeline]
* [Razevedo1994. “Data-engineering.” GitHub. https://github.com/razevedo1994/data-engineering.][github-razevedo-1994]
* [Sspaeti. “Building a Data Engineering Project in 20 Minutes.” Sspaeti. 9 March 2021. https://sspaeti.com/blog/data-engineering-project-in-twenty-minutes/.][sspaeti-data-engineer-project-20min]
* [Vanhack Admin. “How to Build a GitHub Portfolio & Get Noticed by Recruiters.” Vanhack. 14 Dec. 2021.][vanhack-github-portfolio]

After you have read through some of these resources,
consider the following in your discussion post:

* How can you develop a strong industry portfolio?
* What content you want to include in that portfolio?
* How can you incorporate your work from this program into
your GitHub portfolio to share with prospective employers?
* How can you use your portfolio to assist you with
industry-specific case interviews or technical evaluations?
* Finally, find some examples online of strong data engineering portfolios and
share them with your peers.
