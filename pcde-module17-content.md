# PCDE Course Module 17 Content

## Introduction

In this module,
you will learn how to use **NiFi** to
perform [extract, transform, and load (ETL)][-etl].
[NiFi is a data pipeline and transformation tool][-nifi] from
the Apache Software Foundation.
In the first section, you will build on your knowledge of ETL in
data engineering from earlier modules.
You will also delve deeper to learn specifics about
the features, capabilities, and architecture of NiFi.
In the next section, you will learn how to use NiFi to facilitate the handling of
data by creating an ETL pipeline.
You will build the components of your ETL pipeline including
creating the database and containers, installing the driver,
and setting up the `FlowFiles`, processors, and connectors.
You will then practice using *NiFi* to work with data in
a variety of different databases.

The mini-lessons and activities in
this section have been tested using a [Windows OS][-windows] and
the Catalina version of a [Mac OS][-macos].
If you use the Big Sur OS,
you are recommended to use the myPhpAdmin container as
demonstrated in this article:
[Run MySQL & phpMyAdmin Locally Using Docker][mysql-phpmyadmin-docker].

**Note**: Make sure you have installed the tools you will need for Modules 17-19 in
the [Course Tools Module][emeritus-course-tools-module] before
beginning this module.
