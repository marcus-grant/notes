# Redis

Redis is an in-memory, key-value store that works with tremendous speed. A key-value store is a type of NoSQL database where *keys* server as unique identifiers for their values. A Redis instance can include various databases, all containing different datatypes.

It is possible to control [Redis using Python drivers](redis-using-python.md).
