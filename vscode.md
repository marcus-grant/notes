# VS Code

VS Code is one of the most popular code editors that prides itself on
being less of an IDE and more of a extension expandable
[source-code editor][code-editor-wiki].
It's not purely a source code editor though due
to those extensions.
Thus it exists within a middle ground between a full IDE and a pure source code editor.
