<!-- TODO: Mermaid of secret sauce slide -->
* Schema-less JSON of different types of customer metadata.
* Added with customized business logic by merchant/charity.
  * Also in JSON.
* With webhooks associated with these two can give custom responses to transactions.
* This is good for example to a charity.
  * If someone donates a large amount to them, but Swish won't allow the amount...
  * The charity might never know this.
  * The webhook and rule engine can then give the charity a heads up.
  * This allows the charity to update their CRM and re-approach the donor.
