# Project 15.2: Creating a Student Grades Database

## Link to Original Page

[PCDE Project 15.2: Emeritus Page][pcde-project-15-2-emeritus]:
This is a link to the original Emeritus Canvas page for the project.
This will be necessary to start the Codio project web app.

## Project Instructions

In this Codio project,
you will practice using Python lists, functions, and dictionaries to
create a database that contains student names,
information about problem sets that were given to them,
and their grades for each problem.

In the first part of this project,
you will work with a simplified version of the database that
is constructed using lists.
Next, you will create a more advanced, faster,
and efficient version of the database that uses dictionaries to store its entries.
Finally,
you will be asked to define some advanced Python functions that
compute the weighted average for each student in the database.

This coding project is designed as a comprehensive assessment of
the topics covered during the module.
The questions in the project are designed to be more difficult than
the ones presented to you throughout the module.
However,
enough detail will be provided to you so that you can successfully complete the project.

Follow the instructions in Codio to complete this activity.
A detailed Codio Quick-Start Guide can be found at the following link:
[Codio Assignment Quick-Start Guide for Python][pcde-codio-quick-guide-python].

For this activity,
you can earn full points by answering all of the questions correctly.
Partial points can be earned.
If some questions are answered correctly,
you will earn the number of points listed for each question that
you have answered correctly.
You are able to check whether you got each question correct after
submitting the activity.
Only the highest mark for each question will be registered in the Grade-book.
You may resubmit the activity until the due date.

Please feel free to refer to
the [Module 15 Q&A Discussion][pcde-mod15-qa-discussion] with
any questions that you have regarding this coding project or
to discuss with your peers.
