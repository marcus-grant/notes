# Probability

This is an overview of probabilities and statistics topics.

## Probability Distributions

### What is a Random Variable?

Random variables are numerical outcomes of random phenomena,
with the range of possible values represented by that variable.

For example,
in the coin toss experiment,
the possible outcomes of tails and heads get mapped to 0 and 1 respectively,
then the random variable **X** will have possible values of 0 or 1.
