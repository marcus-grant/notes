# Docker

## Introduction

Docker is one of the most common software platforms used to create and run containers.

## Do Not Use Docker If

* You need a speed boost
* If you prioritize security over convenience
* If you develop desktop GUI applications
* If you want to facilitate development
* If you need to use different OSs or kernels
* If you have a lot of valuable data to store
* If you are looking for an easily managed technology
