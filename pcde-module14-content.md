# PCDE Module 14 Content: Java & Debezium

## Discussion 14.1: Compare and Contrast Java and Python

### Prompt

As you continue to learn the differences between
[Java][java-zk] and [Python][py-zk] programming,
it is important to consider the use cases for each.
Java has statically set variable types and a faster runtime because
it is a compiled language.
However, Python can usually be written with fewer lines of code and
is an interpreted language, so there is no need to compile.
Regardless of their differences,
both are among the most commonly used programming languages in the industry.

In this discussion,
you will select **two** projects from the list below and
give **three** reasons why each project should be written in Python, Java, or
some combination of the two.
Consider factors such as scalability, modularity, speed, and
configurability when deciding which technology to use.

#### Project Scenarios

1. Product Pre-Order Website:
Your organization has just released a new product,
and they need to take pre-orders.
This web interface will have to communicate to a back-end project,
relay data to and from a database, accept credit card payments, and
it is expected to have high traffic at the time of the product’s release.
2. Weather Predictor:
You’re working on a pre-existing website that
displays the weather for the next 10 days.
You get data from a centralized API, and you wish to
further enhance the API’s predictions.
The website is already designed,
your team has tasked you with analyzing incoming data and
communicating new predictions with the web interface.
3. Data Collection and Management:
Your team collects specific data from
a competitor’s website and places it in a .csv file.
Your task is to write a program that reads the file,
does any necessary processing, and then places the data in a database.
Your program will be run on an automated schedule and will have no interface.
4. Online Chess:
The task is to make an online chess game where
players can compete against their friends.
You also want to add chess bots with differing levels of difficulty.
The game is also expected to be the best of its kind and very popular,
so scalability is crucial.
5. Tracking COVID-19 Trends:
Your organization has tasked you with writing a program that
will look at employee infection data and attempt to predict when
the next case spike will occur.
This will help manufacturing prepare for the loss in the workforce.
The tool will be used by management and
will use a very large data set since the organization has over 100,000 employees.

Read the statements posted by your peers.
Engage with them by responding with thoughtful comments and
questions to deepen the discussion.

**Suggested Time**: 60 minutes

**Suggested Length**: 300 words

This is a required activity and will count toward course completion.
