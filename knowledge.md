# Knowledge

## Introduction

>**Knowledge** is a form of awareness or familiarity.
>It is often understood as awareness of facts or as practical skills,
>and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations.
>Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge,
>is often defined as true belief that is distinct from
>opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification.
>While there is wide agreement among philosophers that
>propositional knowledge is a form of true belief,
>many controversies in philosophy focus on justification.
>This includes question like whether justification is needed at all,
>how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed.

**Epistemology** is the branch of philosophy concerned with
**knowledge** and **belief**.
