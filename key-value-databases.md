# Key-Value Databases

In terms of complexity,
on the extreme end of most complexity would lie a relational database.
On the other end of the spectrum would be a **key-value** database.

It resembles a dictionary or a hash table that
gets used in most programming languages.
You set **key-value** pairs,
then you can retrieve the *value* by using the *key*.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory, key-value store that works with tremendous speed.
It is often used as a cache or a database specifically for more ephemeral data.
Data such as user sessions, shopping carts, or other data that is not critical to
the application but receives a lot of traffic.
