# User Interface (UI)

## Introduction

>In the industrial design field of humanâ€“computer interaction,
>a **user interface** (**UI**) is the space where interactions between
>humans and machines occur.
>The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of
>the machine from the human end,
>while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that
>aids the operators' decision-making process.

User Interfaces are in short any system used to
aid a user in the operation of a machine.
This can include anything as sophisticated as highly abstract software to
something as primitive as simple un-powered hand-tools.
This is therefore a field in industrial design.

## Computer Interfaces - Computer Peripherals

One big area of design and research is in creating user interfaces between
humans and computers.
Since we're dealing with the five senses (we'll ignore smell and taste for now),
below are examples of each kind of sense that has active research and
mature works.

* **Sound**
  * Audio Interfaces
  * Voice Assistants
  * Speech Synthesis
  * Audio Engineering
* **Touch**

  * Computer Mice
  * Braille Interfaces
