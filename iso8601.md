# ISO 8601 Date and Time Format Standard

According to [Wikipedia][iso8601-wiki]:

>**ISO 8601** is an international standard covering the worldwide exchange and
>communication of date and time-related data.
>It is maintained by the Geneva-based International Organization for
>Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988,
>with updates in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019, and an amendment in 2022.

To put it simply, the format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
Where:

* `YYYY` is the year
* `MM` is the month
* `DD` is the day
* `HH` is the hour
* `MM` is the minute
* `SS` is the second
  * `SS` can be a decimal number so `SS.SSS` is also valid
* `Z` is the timezone offset
  * `Z` is UTC
  * `+HH:MM` is a positive offset from UTC
  * `-HH:MM` is a negative offset from UTC
  * So `+01:00` is one hour ahead of UTC, and is also Central European Time (CET)

## Partial Dates

The standard also allows for partial dates, such as `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY`.
Basically,
any omitted part is assumed to be the lowest possible value for that part.
So omitting the seconds part of the time, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ` is valid,
But omitting the year, `--MM-DDTHH:MMZ` is not.
