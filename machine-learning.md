# Machine Learning

## Introduction

>**Machine Learning** (**ML**) is a field devoted to understanding and
>building methods that let machines "learn" -
>that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on set of tasks.
>-- [Wikipedia - Machine Learning][wiki-machine-learning]

Machine learning [algorithms][-algo] build a model based on sample data,
known as **training data**, in order to make predictions or decisions without
being explicitly programmed to do so.
Machine learning are used in a wide set of applications.
These include, but are not at all limited to:

* email filtering
* computer vision
* speech recognition
* agriculture
* industrial processes and robotics
* recommendation systems
