## Foundational Mathematics

**Foundational mathematics** is the study of the most basic concepts and
logical structure of mathematics.
It generally includes topics from theories of logic, set theory,
computation, and model theory.

>***TODO*** these sub branches need note pages and links to them.

## Algebra

**Algebra** is one of the older and more broad parts of mathematics.
It is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols.
It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.

This includes topics of:

* Number Theory
* Combinatorics
* Algebraic Geometry
* Linear Algebra

## Geometry

**Geometry** is the study of shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures,
and the properties of space and spatial relationships (*topology*).

* Euclidean Geometry
* Non-Euclidean Geometry
* Discrete Geometry
* Graph Theory
* General Topology

## Applied Mathematics

**Applied mathematics** is the study of mathematical methods that are
typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry.
It moves mathematical theory from pure mathematics to
the real world application of mathematics.

It includes topics of:

* Mathematical Physics
* Computer Science
* [Probability][-prob] and Statistics
* Game Theory
* Systems & Control Theory

## Analysis

**Mathematical analysis** is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and
related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite series,
and analytic functions.

It includes topics of:

* Real Analysis and Measure Theory
* Complex Analysis
* Tensor & Vector Analysis
* [Calculus][-calc]
* Functional Analysis
