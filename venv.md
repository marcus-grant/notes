# Virtual Environment (Python venv)

## Introduction

The program `venv` is a [Python][py] module that provides support for
creating lightweight and segregated Python execution environments.
According to the [Python Foundation's Documentation][py-docs-venv]:

>The **venv** module supports creating lightweight "virtual environments",
>each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in
>their site directories.
>A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python installation,
>known as the virtual environmentâ€™s "base" Python,
>and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment,
>so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available.

Using `venv` is the recommended way to create and manage virtual environments and
is part of managing the versions of [python and its dependencies][-py-version].
