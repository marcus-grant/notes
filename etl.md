# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

## Introduction

According to [Wikipedia][wiki-etl]:

>In computing, extract, transform, load (ETL) is a three-phase process where
>data is extracted, transformed (cleaned, sanitized, scrubbed) and
>loaded into an output data container.
>The data can be collated from one or more sources and it can also be output to
>one or more destinations.
>ETL processing is typically executed using software applications but
>it can also be done manually by system operators.
>ETL software typically automates the entire process and can be run manually or
>on reoccurring schedules either as single jobs or aggregated into a batch of jobs.
