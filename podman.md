# Podman (Software Container Runtime)

## Introduction

**Podman** is a container runtime for unix-like or
[Linux][-linux] [operating systems][-os].
It is driven by the OCI (Open Container Initiative) so
it is always [Free and Open Source][-foss].
Unlike [Docker][-docker],
which [podman][home-podman] is intended to be a drop-in replacement for,
podman doesn't require daemons to run,
is designed linux concepts of software management,
and most importantly isn't run by a profit seeking entity.
