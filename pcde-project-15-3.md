# Project 15.3: Redundant Dictionaries in Python

## Instructions

### Original Emeritus Canvas Page

These are summarized instructions for the project.
There is a javascript web app only accessible through
the [original page][pcde-project-15-3-emeritus].

### Project Instructions

In this Codio project,
you will practice using Python lists, functions, and redundant dictionaries to
create a database that contains student names,
information about problem sets that
were given to them, and their grades for each problem.

In this project,
you will use some of the functions that
were defined in [Project 15.2: Project 2 Part 1][-pcde-project-15-2] to
initialize your database.

The goal of this project is for you to improve the functions to
create the database by using redundant dictionaries to
define a database that contains the weighted average for each student.

Follow the instructions in Codio to complete this activity.
A detailed Codio Quick-Start Guide can be found at the following link:
[Codio Assignment Quick-Start Guide for Python][pcde-codio-quick-guide-python].

For this activity,
you can earn full points by answering all of the questions correctly.
Partial points can be earned.
If some questions are answered correctly,
you will earn the number of points listed for each question that
you have answered correctly.
You are able to check whether you got each question correct after
submitting the activity.
Only the highest mark for each question will be registered in
the Grade-book.
You may resubmit the activity until the due date.

Please feel free to refer to
the [Module 15 Q&A Discussion][pcde-mod15-qa-discussion] with
any questions that you have regarding this coding project or
to discuss with your peers.
