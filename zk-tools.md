# Zettelkasten Tools

The key to a modern [Zettelkasten Method](zk.md)
is the use of personalized software to automate aspects of the method.
Thank goodness we're no longer in the days of Niklas Luhman,
the inventor of the Zettelkasten Method,
where he used a paper and pen version of the method.
So here are some tools;
including pre-made, contributed to, and customized by hand to implement the method.

## Automate Text Expansion of Abbreviations and Shorthands

One of the ways to take better [lecture notes](notes-lectures.md)
using the Zettelkasten method,
is to use [abbreviations][notes-abbreviations] and [shorthands][notes-shorthands].
But this potentially makes reading and reviewing notes less effective.
One way to get around this is to make custom or configured scripts to
parse notes for these known shortands and expand the text.
This could be done with the actual notes documents themselves,
or only when the notes are turned to reviewable web pages or rendered documents.

I think it's preferable to leave the original documents themselves with
those shorthands.
That way the editors in use can make use of the less narrow widths to
be more easily read there.

### OS-Level Abbreviations

Breaking with the suggestion above where
we should keep shorthands within the original note documents,
one option is to use an OS feature for [text expansion](text-expansion.md).

## Checking Grammar

There's both editor tools, usually Language Server Protocol servers
that will analyze static code, like markdown.
The [Zettelkasten Tools Notes](zk-tools.md#checking-grammar) has more details.
