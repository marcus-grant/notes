# Integral Calculus

## Introduction

>In mathematics, an **integral** is the continuous analog of a sum,
>which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations.
>Integration, the process of computing an integral,
>is one of the two fundamental operations of [calculus][-calc],
>the other being [differentiation][-deriv].
>Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics,
>such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity.
>Today integration is used in a wide variety of scientific fields.
