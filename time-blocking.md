How do you balance the necessary evils of meetings,
email, team, chat and *busy work* with focused time?
Since becoming a digital hermit isn't an option for most of us,
it's important to concentrate on strategies to
help focus in a world designed to distract us.

Time blocking is a time management method to divide the day into blocks of time.
Each block dedicated to accomplishing a set of specific tasks.
Instead of keeping an open-ended to-do list of things you'll get to as time allows,
start each day with a concrete schedule that lays out what you'll work on and when.

[time-management-wise](time-management.md),
and to refine the process and plan for the next week.

## Task Batching
