# Limit (Mathematical)

## Introduction

>In mathematics, a **limit** is the value that
>a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.
>Limits are essential to [calculus][-calc] and mathematical analysis,
>and are used to define continuity, [derivatives][-deriv], and [integrals][-integral].

## Basics

### General Form

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is written as

$$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L $$
