# Git

According to [Wikipedia][git-wiki]:

>Git (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed version control system that
>tracks changes in any set of computer files,
>usually used for coordinating work among
>programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
>Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
>non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

**Git** is often associated with [**GitHub**][github-zk] which
is a web-based software hosting service that makes use of Git to
create its multitude of software development workflows.

There are a lot of features and workflows in [GitHub][github-zk],
too many that it deserves its own document.
But here there are some of the most common ones:

* Software repository
* Code viewer
* Bug tracking
* Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CICD)
* Codespaces
