# Asynchronous Programming

## Introduction

>Asynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of
>events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events.
>These may be "outside" events such as the arrival of signals,
>or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with
>program execution, without the program blocking to wait for results.
