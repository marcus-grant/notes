# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

>The **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) is one of the main protocols of
>the [Internet protocol suite][-tcpip].
>It originated in the initial network implementation in which
>it complemented the [Internet Protocol (IP)][-ip].
>Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as [TCP/IP][-tcpip].
>TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of
>a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on
>hosts communicating via an IP network.
