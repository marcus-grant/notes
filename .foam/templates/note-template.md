Welcome to Foam templates.

What you see in the heading is a placeholder

- it allows you to quickly move through positions of the new note by pressing TAB,
e.g. to easily fill fields
- a placeholder optionally has a default value, which can be some text or, as in this case, a [variable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables)
  - when landing on a placeholder, the default value is already selected so you can easily replace it
- a placeholder can define a list of values, e.g.: ${2|one,two,three|}
- you can use variables even outside of placeholders, here is today's date: ${CURRENT_YEAR}/${CURRENT_MONTH}/${CURRENT_DATE}

For a full list of features see [the VS Code snippets page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax).
