# Time Management Skills Overview

This is an overview of some useful time management skills to revisit and
refine as time goes on.

## Ongoing Tasks Time Management Topics

This sub-section is mostly here to provide a link to ongoing task management
like the [MIT xPro Data Engineering Course](pcde-course-overview.md),
which requires immense ongoing task time management.
Use them as tips for any other time management tasks as well.
**Important** update and reorganize this in the future for
better notes atomicity and linking/tagging.

### Create Routines & Stick to Them

First things first,
set up a time where you forecast any recurring tasks for the week ahead.
Make this a weekly ritual.
Sundays are usually a good day to do this.
Or maybe Monday mornings as the first thing to do before work hours begin,
if work hours allows it.

Build time blocks into the days that will be dedicated ongoing tasks like
the [MIT xPro Data Engineering Course](pcde-course-overview.md).
Consider assigning particular tasks to particular days

Consider assigning particular ongoing tasks to particular days.
In the [Data Engineering Course](pcde-course-overview.md) this could mean;
taking dedicated days for video lectures and readings then
[note-taking](notetaking.md).
Be sure to include interaction with advisors,
supervisors, bosses, etc. as much as possible.

Use calendering systems to keep yourself accountable.
This might include due dates, meetings, recurring reminders to refine the process.
More information on time-blocking can be found [here][time-blocking-todoist].
Or personalized here with notes on [time-blocking techniques]

### Optimize your Work within your Time Blocks

Review the due dates for different tasks.
In the [Data Engineering Course](pcde-course-overview.md),
this could be the guidepost times for module content.
Prioritize due dates for deliverables accordingly.

Work through tasks one at a time.
Make sure to employ some [time blocking techniques](time-blocking.md).

Don't over do it!
The human brain can really only work on something for 45 minutes, maximum.
After that increased consecutive time spent on a task will
give diminishing returns in productivity.
Take breaks (for 5 minutes or more) at least every 45 minutes.
Reward yourself for your productivity, and return to work with fresh eyes.
The [pommodoro technique](time-blocking.md#the-pommodoro-granular-time-blocking-technique)
is particularly effective here.
Make sure you review the notes on the pommodoro technique as stated before,
but also check out articles like [this][pommodoro-technique-doist].

### Stay Rested

Sleep plays a huge role in memory formation and cognition.
Don't overdo tasks, even when behind.
Not getting enough sleep is worse for productive time than
resting and returning to the tasks.

In your calendar, schedule wind-down periods and
set a deadline for yourself for tasks on when you'll sign off for the day.
In the case of the [Data Engineering Course](pcde-course-overview.md),
this wind-down is on-top of work hours where you'll wind down and
transition to regular work.
