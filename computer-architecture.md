# Computer Architecture

## Introduction

>**Computer architecture** is a description of the structure of
>a computer system made from component parts.
>It can sometimes be a high-level description that
>ignores details of the implementation.
>At a more detailed level,
>the description may include the instruction set architecture design
>micro-architecture design, logic design, and implementation.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The core of any computer architecture is the **central processing unit** CPU.

## Embedded Systems

>**Note:** For more details: see [Embedded Systems][-embed]

**Embedded Systems** are a special kind of *computer architecture*.
They have a focus on being embedded as a part of a larger whole of
a computer system.
This means they emphasize tighter peripheral interfaces with
realtime constraints.
As well as lower power consumption and modularity to other embedded systems that
will compose a larger computer or electronic system.
