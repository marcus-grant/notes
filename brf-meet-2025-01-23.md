# BRF Capital Raising Meeting 2025-01-23

This is a special meeting due to a vote not going through on
a capital raising for BRF Infanteristen 20.

## Meeting Minutes

* Primary goal here is to reduce BRF debts for sake of...
  * Reducing private fees
  * Improve collective and individual property values
  * Create a healthy buffer for emergency expenses
  * Reducing our price sensitivity due to interest rates
* This is all in reference to the budget presentation by Hans.
  * Shows current budget and some estimates of the situation if
    capital raising is performed.
* Some concerns fro neighbors:
  * Someone was wondering if there's any guarantees that
    private loans would cost more than BRF fee reductions.
    * Response is that there are now guarantees there, we need cash buffer.
    * At least the *revers* would be tied to an apartment sale.
  * Questions about Garage BRF:
    * For the 2025-2029 period we're budgeting for
      is expected to provide *100k~150kSEK* annually.
    * Part of this cash buffer we potentially want is due to risks to
      our collective income
      * Garage BRF might not always be able to provide this much profit for
        us as an example.
* Potential risks the cash buffer would guard against:
  * Garage BRF not earning as much as expected
  * Unexpected fees like broken wash equipment or electrical
    * As an example we've avoided fixing the large drying closet
  * Our renting tenants might leave and not get replaced quickly
* All this creates for more reactive apartment fees and less price stability.
  * For our part, that's not as big an issue so long as it's transparent.
* Lots of discussions about where we can save on costs
  * Waste management is the biggest potential saving
    * New contract will have to be reached with a new garbage transit service.
      * Contract ends in late March 2025.
    * A big saving opportunity is to do more of our own private sorting.
      * Duh, why the hell aren't we doing this already?
      * Suggestions to build a trash center outside in the courtyard where
        it would be much cheaper for collection.
        * Not only because sorting is expensive...
        * ...but also because they have to use specialist small trucks that
          cost more to perform the pickup.
        * More details to come, but this is a worthwhile BRF cost cutting option.
        * If we do this expect to privately separate at least...
          * Food waste
          * Plastic
          * Metal
          * Glass
* There's a lot of discussing of our private responsibilities to reduce costs.
  * That is our actions privately have an impact on smaller collective savings.
  * The trash issue is a big part of that.
    * If we throw away things down the chute we shouldn't;
      * Then the trash collectors will charge more that week.
    * Keeping collective spaces clean and in good order.
      * The cleaners and building services will
        have to be here longer twice a month and that costs more.
  * Private heating affects collective BRF costs.
    * The amount of heating energy we use (electric, or district heating)
      * There's delivery charges that the BRF pays related how much we all use.
    * We can pinch cut costs with better insulation.
    * Also with better habits:
      * Lowering thermostats.
      * Automating when we're not here.
      * Shutting off lights.
      * Less hot running water.
      * Etc, you get the idea.
    * Some residents are actually getting better insulation to deal with drafts.
  * TLDR: There's probably about 100kSEK to be saved if our habits are better.
* Some of the residents have been probing the market for our collective and private valuations.
  * Mixed signals really.
  * Some people's values have already gone up, some down.
  * Seems mostly related to when they bought and how large the apartment is.
    * Seems like the larger apartments haven't fared as well.
* Decision
  * Voted on 2025-02-11
  * Requires 2/3 supermajority
  * If voted yes, we can choose to pay some or all in cash.
    * Our case we will probably take the loan
    * Will be given as a bill from
      the financing firm listed in the budget presentation.
