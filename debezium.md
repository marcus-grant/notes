# Debezium

GNU nano is a user-friendly command line text editor for
Unix and Linux operating systems.
It includes all the basic functionality of a text editor,
such as "text content create/update,
search and replace with regular expression support,
spell checking, and more" (Linuxize 2021).

## Basic Operations

### Open

Open a file on the command line by using the `nano` command followed by the file name.

```bash
nano hello.txt
```

### Creating a New File

Same as opening a file, but the file does not exist yet.

### Saving a File

To save a file, press `Ctrl+O` and then press `Enter` to confirm the file name.
Use `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor.

### Search and Replace

To search text, enter `Ctrl+W` and then enter the text to search for.
After entering search mode, using `Alt+W` will search for the next occurrence of the text.
