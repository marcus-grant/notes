# Embedded System

Hello World!
>An **embedded system** is a [computer system][-comp-arch] —
>a combination of a computer processor, computer memory,
>and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within
>a larger mechanical or electronic system.
>It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or
>electronic hardware and mechanical parts.
>Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of
>the machine that it is embedded within,
>it often has [real-time][-ros] computing constraints.
>Embedded systems control many devices in common use.
>In 2009, it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of
>all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.
